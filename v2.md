# DataFire v2
The latest version of DataFire is on this branch (v2). The API may still change,
and certain features have not been implemented yet (see TODO)

## What's new?
* Combined `Operation` class and `Flow` class into single `Action` class
* Using promises instead of callbacks
* Integrations fully managed by npm
* Introduced DataFire.yml for defining API endpoints, tasks, metadata

## Usage

To use the v2 build, run
```
npm install https://github.com/DataFire/DataFire#v2
npm install -g https://github.com/DataFire/DataFire#v2
```

To use v2 integrations, you'll need to clone locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/DataFire/Integrations && cd Integrations
git checkout v2
cd /path/to/your/project
npm install /path/to/Integrations/$integration
```

## TODO
* Implement auth as stated in [docs/Authentication.md](docs/Authentication.md)
* Implement `datafire build` to generate a serverless/AWS project
* Implement `mongodb` integration
* Implement pagination
* Rewrite sample projects
